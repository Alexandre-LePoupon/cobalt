{"name":"Cobalt","tagline":"Cobalt Hybrid Framework - the best of both world !","body":"### Welcome to Cobalt Hybrid Framework.\r\n\r\nCobalt is a web and native framework to create mobile applications that can mix web technologies and native technologies.\r\n\r\nIt provides :\r\n* a solid communication tool between web and native\r\n* some pre-packaged features such as native push/pop transitions between HTML pages, native pull-to-refresh with javascript hooks, and more\r\n* **plugins**, to bring your own joy to this happy mix\r\n\r\n### HTML5 versus Native apps : why choosing? use both !\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to ease the development of hybrid mobile apps, and avoid choosing between native and web : you can just use both and take advantage of the best of each.\r\n\r\n### Cobalt is not PhoneGap / Cordova\r\n\r\nCordova aims to bring native API access to javascript, and let you create the whole app with HTML5.\r\n\r\nWe think that HTML5 is not ready yet : It is hard to create ultra smooth transitions between pages (old devices), touch events are slow as hell, scrolling can be hard if you have a static header/footer, etc\r\n\r\nWe propose a navigation system between web pages, some cool native components to play with and a solid communication system to let you do native things your way.\r\n\r\nCobalt use native components where HTML5 fails.\r\n\r\nread more aboute Cobalt versus Cordova **here**\r\n\r\n### features and platforms\r\n\r\nCobalt is ready for iOs, Android, BlackBerry 10, Tizen, and soon Windows Phone\r\n\r\nCurrent Features are :\r\n\r\n* native push/pop called from javascript\r\n* customisable native pull-to-refresh\r\n* infiniteScroll detection\r\n* native alerts from javascript (choose title, text, buttons and be warned on the result)\r\n* web layers : create sexy popups with a second html layer\r\n* native fullscreen videoPlayer\r\n* toasts\r\n* OS buttons (back, menu, ...)\r\n\r\nWe also fixed localStorage on Android and Ajax on BlackBerry10 (read more).\r\n\r\nAll the details are in the github wiki and on the roadmap\r\n\r\nAlso be sure to watch on the plugin directory\r\n\r\n### they use Cobalt !\r\n\r\nHelloCoton, CodeDArmor, BFMTV, BFM Business, RMC, RMC Sport, 01net, you !\r\n\r\n\r\n### Who are the Cobaltians ?\r\n\r\nWe are french frogs from brittany, who love to create great native apps, use html5 and mix the both. The Cobalt idea came with some app developped at Haploid.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
