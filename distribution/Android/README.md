## Android distribution

Unfortunately, we can't provide an easy-to-integrate private library yet as Android library projects can't be exported into a JAR with their resources and Cobalt rely on a third-party Android library project [(Source)](https://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html#considerations).

In a next dev session, we will emancipate Cobalt from this Android library project in order to provide a JAR.
