### How to use ?

**don't** use theses one if you just want to use the framework.

use the concatened version in [../../distribution](../../distribution) instead.

there is a minified version too.

### How does it work ?

javascript files are split into a common file for all OS and a platform adapter for each OS.

There is no "all in one file with autodetection" yet. but we think about it.
